                <p>
                    For the Dough:
                    2 cups whole wheat flour,
                    ½ tsp salt,
                    ¾ cup water (adjust as needed),
                    1 tsp oil or ghee (optional),
                    For the Potato Filling:
                    3 medium potatoes, boiled & mashed,
                    1 green chili, finely chopped (optional),
                    ½ tsp cumin seeds,
                    ½ tsp red chili powder,
                    ½ tsp garam masala,
                    ½ tsp turmeric powder,
                    1 tsp coriander powder,
                    2 tbsp chopped coriander leaves (cilantro),
                    ½ tsp dry mango powder (amchur) or lemon juice,
                    Salt to taste,
                    For Cooking:
                    Ghee or butter for roasting
                   <h2>Instructions:</h2> 
                   <pre><p class="ap1">
     Step 1: Prepare the Dough.In a bowl, mix wheat flour and salt.Gradually add water and knead into a soft, smooth dough.
            Apply a little oil, cover, and let it rest for 20-30 minutes.

     Step 2: Make the Potato Filling. Boil and mash the potatoes. Add green chilies, cumin seeds, spices, coriander leaves, and salt. Mix well.
             Ensure there are no lumps so the paratha rolls smoothly.

     Step 3: Stuff & Roll the Paratha. Divide the dough and potato filling into equal-sized balls.
             Roll out one dough ball into a small circle (about 4 inches).Place a ball of stuffing in the center, seal the edges, and gently flatten it.
             Roll it out carefully into a 6-8 inch circle, dusting with flour if needed.

    Step 4: Cook the Paratha.Heat a tava or pan over medium heat. Place the paratha on the pan and cook for 1-2 minutes until bubbles form.
            Flip and apply ghee or butter.Cook until golden brown spots appear on both sides.
            Repeat for the remaining parathas.</p>
